                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Currently a senior at Westminster University, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics, and expected to graduate in May 2025.
                    My senior capstone project is focused on building a platform for visualizing, live testing, and back-testing mathematical and machine learning strategies on
                    sequential financial data.</p>

                    <p>With over four summers of internship experience, I’ve built scalable, high-throughput applications, developing skills in backend engineering,
                custom integrations, data science, web scraping, optimization, and front-end development.</p>

                    <p>Strong personal skills in teamwork, adaptability, communication, problem-solving, and leadership were developed through my time as a
                        team leader in Software Engineering roles and as a NAUI Dive Master and First Mate, where I taught sailing, scuba diving, free diving, and marine biology.</p>

                    <p>Passionate about ocean health and research, I'm always looking for ways to apply my skills, have some fun, and contribute to helping our oceans.</p>

                    <p>Currently seeking new opportunities in Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Quantitative Research.

                    Excited to explore what's next!</p>
