                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Currently a senior at Westminster University, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics, and expected to graduate in May 2025.
                    My senior capstone project is focused on building a platform for visualizing, live testing, and back-testing mathematical and machine learning strategies on
                    sequential financial data.</p>

                    <p>With over four summers of internship experience, I’ve built scalable, high-throughput applications, developing skills in backend engineering,
                custom integrations, data science, web scraping, optimization, and front-end development.</p>

                    <p>Strong personal skills in teamwork, adaptability, communication, problem-solving, and leadership were developed through my time as a
                        team leader in Software Engineering roles and as a NAUI Dive Master and First Mate, where I taught sailing, scuba diving, free diving, and marine biology.</p>

                    <p>Passionate about ocean health and research, I'm always looking for ways to apply my skills, have some fun, and contribute to helping our oceans.</p>

                    <p>Currently seeking new opportunities in Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Quantitative Research.

                    Excited to explore what's next!</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Creativity: My senior capstone project was focused around creating a framework to assist in developing strategies for algorithmic trading. I created a
                    database to store information about back tests, model training, and market data as well as a server to listen to live market updates inorder to update the database
                    and the client in real time. I also created a python framework to interact with the database, server, back test strategies, and visualize data inorder to abstract
                    the parts of development that all strategies require. Using this framework I developed a machine learning based trading strategy using Torch which demonstrated my
                    creativity in being able to pull together my knowledge learned from school and person projects to create something unique and profitable in a highly competitive field.

                    <li>Web-based multiplayer math game for kids</li>
                </ul>
                    <p>Collaboration: Jungle Jump was an educational math game designed for elementary school students to practice their math skills from class in an enjoyable way.
                        It allowed for a teacher to create a classrooms with custom or generated levels based on difficulty and types of problems they wanted students to practice.
                        Levels could be played single player to practice or as a live multiplayer match against their class mates to show off their skills. Teachers had the ability
                        to see reports based off the overall score of a student as well as what types of questions they were getting correct or failing to answer as well as their
                        times for different questions and difficulties. This project was built in a team following agile methodologies and showcases my ability to work in groups bringing
                        in varied ideas and skills while following best practices in versions management, testing, and delivery.

                    <li>Web scraped and stored all homes for sale in Utah in a SQL Database over a three month period</li>
                    <li>Created an interactive web app to query homes and created a statistical report on home values</li>
                </ul>
                    <p>Critical Thinking: The Home Finding Application and Database project highlights critical thinking by addressing the challenge of housing data
                        accessibility and insights for potential buyers in Utah. Through web scraping,
                        relevant data was extracted, and structured into an accessible SQL database over three months. This foundation enabled the creation
                        of an interactive web app for querying homes, complemented by a statistical report on home values and trends. The project demonstrates the
                        ability to explore issues, such as fluctuating housing prices and buyer needs, and to formulate data-driven conclusions to
                        inform users effectively.

                    <li>Used TCP sockets to build a client and server for a simple messaging app</li>
                </ul>
                    <p>Communication: This project shows communication in both a technical and collaborative way. I worked with a partner to develop our version of the client
                         server as well as a larger group to develop our protocol to allow for clients and server to communicate over TCP sockets using the same protocol. The server
                         was built using java and the client was built in Swift for Mac os. My partner and I worked closely to make sure our project worked seamlessly while also having
                         to communicate with our group to make sure our protocol was working and to update each other when changes were needed. The end result was a multi-threaded server
                         capable of connecting multiple clients and a client with an easy-to-use UI, seamless connection to server, and a translation layer allowing connection to servers
                         built with a protocol developed by a separate team.

                        I worked with a non profit called BLEU World that collects data on ocean health around Southern California. The website I created allowed for
                        fast entry of detailed data about fish populations, coral health, ocean temperature, and other key metrics in an intuitive format that made
                        repetitive data entry significantly faster. This data was stored in a postgres database indexed by geo data to allow for advanced aggregation to create
                         reports based on various parameters over time.
